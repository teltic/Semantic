<!-- This code is very unorganized for IMBD's website.  It is shocking that a website
this popular can have code this unorganized.  They should use more divs to help better 
organize their layout.  They could probably get better search results from google if they 
organized it better.  -->

<!-- I would use div class and IDs with names that ctually describe what part of the website
this belongs for (for example: jumbotron, body, header, footer, navigation bar, etc) -->
